# Olympic Winners Prediction Analysis


## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes information on:
- **Gender**: The gender of the athletes (Male/Female).
- **Age**: The age of the athletes.
- **Height**: The height of the athletes.
- **Weight**: The weight of the athletes.
- **Medals**: The medals won (Gold, Silver, Bronze) or if the athlete did not win.

The dataset consists of **15 instances** representing Olympic athletes. For each athlete, whether they were winners or not is noted, and if they won a medal, the type of medal (Gold, Silver, Bronze) is mentioned.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to:
1. Predict the **average performance** of Olympic winners across different periods.
2. Analyze the dataset to gain insights into trends related to the winners' characteristics (e.g., age, gender, height, weight).
3. Use **RapidMiner** to perform data analysis and make predictions on future Olympic winners based on the data from previous years.

## Tools and Technologies

- **RapidMiner**: A powerful data science platform used to analyze and build predictive models.
- **Python (optional)**: For advanced analysis and integration if needed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Load the Dataset into RapidMiner**: Open RapidMiner Studio and import the dataset into the platform.
3. **Create a Workflow**: Use RapidMiner’s drag-and-drop interface to build your analysis workflow.
   - Preprocess the data (e.g., handling missing values, normalizing, etc.).
   - Use RapidMiner’s machine learning operators to build predictive models.
   - Visualize the results of your analysis.
4. **Predict Future Winners**: Based on the previous Olympic data, predict the performance of athletes in future Olympic events.
